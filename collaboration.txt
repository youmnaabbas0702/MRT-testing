			TWO COMMON COLLABORATIVE WORK FLOWS:

	1-SHARED REPOSITORY MODEL:

For small projects where you are basically in the same physical space (e.g. lab with offices near each other).
Be careful! You are cloning the main repository.
Everyone has push and pull access to the central repo, so be careful and:
Never commit to the master directly.
Always do your work on a different branch from master.

	2- FORK AND PULL MODEL:

This is the model used by U of T Coders on its own website and repos.
The “owner”/”Project Leader” of the upstream repo assigns rights to “Collaborators”
Collaborators do not have push access to main (upstream) repo
Project Lead accepts Pull Requests (PRs) fro collaborators, reviews them, then merges them into main repo.
